# Creating Restfull API with Python and Flask

### I’m creating a basic API with the following methods:
-	Get
-	Post
-	Put
-	Delete

### I’m using the platform PostMan to test the API.
### I’m also using the framework Flask.

# Installing Flask on SO Windows

### 1. If you do find that pip is not available when using Python 3.4+ or Python 2.7.9+, simply execute e.g.:

    ```
    py -3 -m ensurepip
    ```

### 2. Download get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt:

    ``` 
    python get-pip.py
    ```

### 3. Then use the following command to instal Flask:

    ```
    pip install flask
    ```
